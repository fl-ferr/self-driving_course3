# Programming Assignment: Final Project: Vehicle State Estimation on a Roadway (Course by University of Toronto)

- [ ] Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement drivable space estimation in 3D.

- [ ] Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement lane estimation.

- [ ] Use the output of semantic segmentation to filter errors in the output of 2D object detectors.

- [ ] Use the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car.
